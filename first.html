	<h1 align="center">Quotes by Albert Einstein</h1>
	<p>A human being is part of a whole, called by us the Universe, a part limited in time and space. 
	He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion 
	of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection 
	for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion 
	to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.
	</P>

	<p>A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is 
	necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after 
	death.
	</p>
	<p>Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does 
	not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence. </P>
	

	<p>Nothing will benefit human health and increase the chances for survival of life on Earth 
	as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.  </P>

	<p>The important thing is not to stop questioning.</p>
