	<p>I acquired this iMac in the winter of 2014 on Craigslist for $15. For that price, it included the original keyboard and mouse, as well as some unrelated
	and rather useless books. So far, it has proven reliable and rather useful. This computer bears some sigificance due to the fact that it both was the first iMac to
 	list for under $1,000, as well as being from the first generation of Macintoshes with slot-loading optical drives.</p>

	<p>For features, it sports:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>350 MHZ PowerPC 750 processor</li>
		<li>24x CD-ROM</li>
		<li>40GB hard drive (replacement due to worn out bearings in original)</li>
		<li>ATI Rage 128	VR</li>
		<li>
	</ul>
