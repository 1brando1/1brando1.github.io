<p align="justify">I acquired this fine Macintosh LC III in the spring of 2012 from a teacher at my middle school. At the time, it had not been used regularly since at least the early 2000s. I was, naturally, ecstatic
to finally have a vintage computer all my own. Along with the computer, I got the matching keyboard, mouse, 520MB external SCSI disk, and the 14" Apple Basic Color monitor. While it has been used less over the succeding years,
 my adoration of this fine vintage machine has not waned. Since I acquired the computer, I have done a few things to it. They are detailed below.</p>
