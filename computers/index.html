		<li> Macintosh LC III</li>
		<li> This is a computer that I acquired in 2012, and have loved ever since. It is currently running a combination of Mac OS 7.5.5 and 8.1. This may raise the question
		"But 8.1 isn't supported on that Mac!", which is fair. However, I used a vintage Internet resource to guide me in modifying the Mac OS 8.0 installer to enable the process.
		While the page is available on the 'net as of this writing in 2018, I will <a href="/computers/lciii/81lciii.html">archive</a> it locally just in case.
